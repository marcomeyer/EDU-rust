// In this video, we'll talk about the Rust standard library; the functionality
// available by default to every program.
// ST
// There are a lot of things in the standard library.
// We've got operations on all the standard types - stuff like parsing and error
// handling.
// The standard library also provides memory management, which will discuss in
// later sections.
// There's a lot of operating system abstractions, from environment and multi-
// processing to file and network I/O.
// Finally, there are a number of collections available in the standard library.
// ST
// Talk about mem management
// ST
// TAlk about networking and I/o
// ST
// Talk about env manipulations
// ST 
// Talk about threading and multiprocessing
// ST
// Rust provides several types of collections. When fixed-length arrays aren't
// enough, you can use sequences: Vecs, which are resizable arrays, are a very
// common way to do this.
// There is also a vec-based double ended queue, when you need a queue data structure.
// Maps and sets are available, and they work with many different kinds of keys, not just
// strings as you may be used to in Ruby or JAvaScript.
// Finally, a very efficient BinaryHeap implementation is available.
// ST
// talk about stdlib philosophy
// ST
// In the next video, we'll do some more realistic coding with these data structures, implementing
// a Fibonnacci calculator.
